Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) – PROG6212
Project Overview:
This project is a Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) for PROG6212, focusing on developing a practical .NET web-based application called the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS). The system streamlines the process of submitting and approving monthly claims for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers.
Roles:
Lecturer: Submits claims, uploads documents, and monitors claim status.
Programme Coordinator (PC): Reviews claims and can approve or return claims.
Academic Manager: Gives the final approval or rejection of claims.

Workflow:
Claims move through the following process:
Lecturer → Programme Coordinator → Academic Manager, with clear status updates at each step.
Project Structure:
Documentation.pdf – Contains design choices, roles, workflow, database structure, GUI layout, and assumptions.

Design Choices / Technology:
Platform: Visual Studio 2022 using ASP.NET Core MVC (browser accessible, easy to deploy). WPF could be used for a desktop version.
Architecture: Layered design: Presentation → Services → Domain → Data.
Assumptions & Constraints:
  • One claim per lecturer per month/year
  • Maximum attachment size: 10MB
  • Calculations based on HourlyRate
  • Roles must follow the workflow order
How to View:

View the UML diagram in UML-Class-Diagram.png.
The README provides an overview of the project and structure.
Future Work:
Implement the CMCS web application using ASP.NET Core MVC.
Connect the database and implement claim submission and approval workflows.
Develop a functional GUI based on the current mockups and design.
